# TOOLS AND COVENTIONS

1. I built a mini-style library for the project which is in the `src/assest/scss` folder
2. I used SCSS preprocessor for the styling and I also use `BEM` naming covention
3. I used Fuse.JS for the search functionality. Fuse is minimal, light weight package for implemnting powerful search functionality.
4. My project structure is inspired by Vue.JS file structure.
