# ESSAY SOLUTION

1. Name of product: Easyr App

2. Easyr is a fintech application that enables users to easily make transactions like, bank transfers, buy airtime, pay electric bills and exchange functionalities for forex and crypto currencies. I choose Easyr beacuse I often face problems when trying to perform forex or crypto exchanges and I have to use different applications and thus I will really want all these feature in one application.

3. Some of improvesments that make Easyr better are:
  > Make the process of Identication verfication less tedious and also verify submitted credentials faster. Like some applications don't access NIN Slip only card so if the can access NIN slips and any other verified government issued ID cards that will make the user experience better.

  > Easyr login credentials recovery is slow and difficult and thus if we can reduce the days and also instead of using only the phone number linked to the users NIN or Drivers License let's make the user to provide a recovery email when signin up to enable us use that as a second method of login credentials recovery.

  > Finally, for the exhange flow is quite long and if we can you confirmation modals that will reduce the number clicks leading to a better user experience.
